        "Microsoft sees all the big companies creating original video content, and they want to get in on the fun. They have decided to create a new movie studio, but the problem is they donâ€™t know anything about creating movies. They have hired a team of data scientist from Flatiron to help them better understand the movie industry. The team is charged with doing data analysis and creating a presentation that explores what type of films are currently doing the best at the box office. The team must then translate those findings into actionable insights that the CEO can use when deciding what type of films they should be creating.\n",
