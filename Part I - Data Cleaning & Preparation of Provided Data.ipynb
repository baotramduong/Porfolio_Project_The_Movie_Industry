    "Film entertainment is big business in the United States and it was estimated that the film entertainment business generated $35.3B in revenue in 2019 (Watson, 2020). The United States is among the biggest film industries in the world in general but also in terms of tickets sold per year, ranking behind China and India.\n",
    "\n",
    "Microsoft sees all the big companies creating original video content, and they want to get in on the fun. They have decided to create a new movie studio, but the problem is they don’t know anything about creating movies. They have hired Flatiron Data Science team to help them better understand the movie industry. Our team is charged with doing data analysis and creating a presentation that explores what type of films are currently doing the best at the box office. We will then translate those findings into actionable insights that the CEO can use when deciding what type of films they should be creating.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this report, we will investigate factors associated with commercially successful movies. This report gives a comprehensive evaluation on factors influencing the box office success of a movie such as production budget, domestic gross, international gross, worldwide gross, genre, source, creative type, production method, vote count, vote average, popularity , release time, runtime, studio, language. The business statements are formulated based on these attributes."

    "These questions were picked because quantitative factors that measure a movie’s success such as the production budget and gross are easily obtainable from reputable industry standard websites like Box Office Mojo, IMDB, Rotten Tomatoes, The MovieDB, and The Numbers. Other attributes such as genres, sources, creative types, production methods, popularity score, average rating, runtime, release date, and production studio are also readily available.\n",
    "\n",
    "From a business perspective, these questions are important because it costs around 65M to produce a major studio movie, plus another 35M for marketing and distribution, so getting it right is crucial (Staff, 2017). As we will see later, not all movies make profit and many take in losses.\n",
    "\n",
    "With many movies, the product life cycle is very short, averaging 9.6 weeks and can be as short as 2 weeks (Stimpert et al., 2008). This cycle is characterized by a peak in revenues at the time of release and then exponentially decay (Stimpert). This is why it is significantly important to “get it right” by the time the movie hits the theater."
