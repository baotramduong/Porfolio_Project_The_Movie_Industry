    "Microsoft sees all the big companies creating original video content, and they want to get in on the fun. They have decided to create a new movie studio, but the problem is they don’t know anything about creating movies. They have hired a team of data scientist from Flatiron to help them better understand the movie industry. The team is charged with doing data analysis and creating a presentation that explores what type of films are currently doing the best at the box office. The team must then translate those findings into actionable insights that the CEO can use when deciding what type of films they should be creating.\n",

    "There are other factors such as star quality, quality of script, director, critics, special effects, marketing campaign, popularity of the film preceding it (if it's a sequel), competition or lack thereof, competition from non-movie events such as weather or news and sport events. However, these are all outside the scope of this project."
