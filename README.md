# Creating the Next Blockbuster Movie Using Data Science
This project was completed as part of Flatiron School's Data Science Bootcamp (November 2020)

## The Deliverables
There are 5 deliverables for this project:

1. A well documented Jupyter Notebook containing any code and comments explaining it.

            - Part 1: Data cleaning from provided data
            
            - Part 2: Data cleaning from scraped data
            
            - Part 3: Data analysis and visualization + actionable insights + conclusion & future works
            
2. An organized README.md file that describes the contents of the repository.
3. A short PowerPoint presentation (delivered as a PDF export) giving a high-level overview of the methodology used and recommendations for non-technical stakeholders.
4. A Blog Post which can be found at: https://btramduong0810.github.io/
5. A Video Walkthrough of my non-technical presentation, can be found at:
