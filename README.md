# Data Science vs. The Movie Industry
This project was completed as part of Flatiron School's Data Science Bootcamp (November 2020)

Film entertainment is big business in the United States and it was estimated that the film entertainment business generated $35.3B in revenue in 2019 (Watson, 2020). The United States is among the biggest film industries in the world in general but also in terms of tickets sold per year, ranking behind China and India.

Microsoft sees all the big companies creating original video content, and they want to get in on the fun. They have decided to create a new movie studio, but the problem is they donâ€™t know anything about creating movies. They have hired Flatiron Data Science team to help them better understand the movie industry. Our team is charged with doing data analysis and creating a presentation that explores what type of films are currently doing the best at the box office. We will then translate those findings into actionable insights that the CEO can use when deciding what type of films they should be creating.

In this report, we will investigate factors associated with commercially successful movies. This report gives a comprehensive evaluation on factors influencing the box office success of a movie such as production budget, domestic gross, international gross, worldwide gross, genre, source, creative type, production method, vote count, vote average, popularity , release time, runtime, studio, language. The business statements are formulated based on these attributes.

## Business Statement

**Q1.** Is there a correlation between production budget and profit? If so, how much should Microsoft invest into production?

**Q2.** What kind of movie contents, in term of genre, source, creative type, production method, perform the best?

**Q3.** Is there a correlation between popularity and positive words of mounth (average rating) and profit? How do they affect the performance of a movie?

**Q4.** When is the best time of year to release a movie?

**Q5.** Is there a correlation between runtime and profit? What is the best runtime?
